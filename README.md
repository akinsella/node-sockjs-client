# SockJS client for node

## status: alpha

It shouldn't be relied on yet

## in brief:

It's a fork of the SockJS client library that doesn't rely on DOM primitives, while still retaining the same interface as the original, making it suitable as a drop-in replacement in code meant originally to run in the browser.  It uses websocket as it's only transport for now.
